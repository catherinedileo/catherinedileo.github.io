  "Room Instructions"

  Get thirty people in a room together.
  Arrange them into a circle.
  Give one of them a fire hose.
  Turn on the fire hose.
  Lock the doors.

  Get sixty people in a room together.
  Arrange them into ten rows of six,
  and have them all walk towards the back wall
  until there are six lines of ten people pressed back to front.
  Hang a heavy chain between the two walls so that they cannot back up.

  Get one hundred people in a room together.
  Have them make comparative lists about who has the most of what.
  Don't stop until everyone maximizes at least one category.
  Make trophies.

  Get a car.
  Drive into wet cement and begin wailing.
  Wait for the cement to dry around your tires.
  Make sure that it is a sweltering day.
  Drip sweat onto the red leather seats and call for help,
  violently and desperately.
  When help comes, act confused.
  Deny everything.
