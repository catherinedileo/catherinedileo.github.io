  An alien is made of metal components,
  Held together with meat tendons, white and wet.

  It makes a noise that no one has ever heard before,
  A thin soapy whistle under an elongated clang.

  There is only one alien, and it canâ€™t move quite right, only left.
  It drips and drags out an oval, eroding the slip silt slate below.
  It bends - and there is a pop, a whine, and a dark damp wind.
