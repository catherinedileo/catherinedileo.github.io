  "The Last Week"

  my sticky sweaty sweetie silky sopping sofa.
  your milky mushy marshy marbled mincemeat mouth.

  we made chocolate cake four times in ten days - pork stew and sweet potato over white rice. whipped cream in a green bowl.

  my sordid scalded squalid scuffled sinking ship
  your messy moldy mottled melted marked-down mattress

  too much sugar in the cream and no vanilla. the royal blue vinyl flooring was cold, and i didnâ€™t feel very well at all.

  my saddened stiffened sore-throated sinful simple situation
  your mental menthol murmured martyred markered motions

  i am pulled up by my wrists. the air outside hurls the images into my eyes faster than usual, and the temperature is as absent as the windows in the kitchen.

  my slim slender sly-eyed silver slippery summer
  your moping mopping meandering misleading miscreant meantime

  I cut up the onions, and I peel the garlic with your nails, never the knife. please come with me to the train station, and i am so sorry.
