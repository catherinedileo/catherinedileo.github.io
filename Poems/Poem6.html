  "My Awesome Friend"

  Thereâ€™s a new friend in the corridor, around the coroner.
  The wet heap cracks a wry smile, placid with dry guile.
  What do you call the dumbest guy at the funeral: a moroner.
  Oh, says the heap, Baby - crank that dial.

  The wet heap can wrangle, mangle, and tangle.
  The new friend watches tentatively
  The dry heap can jingle, jangle, and attack (at a sharp angle).
  The new friend watches tentatively.

  The new friend watches tentatively.
  the Heap baby Crank That Dial, smiles.
  Heap Baby, come on baby, crank that dial.
  The coroner and the moroner have eloped (mauraded) in to the corner.

  the Wet Heap trains its shaggy and stinking eye on the onerous oners
  maroping in the corner. Some might call them goner owners.
  Mother loaner brother loners.  Wet Heap Baby, CRANK THAT DIAL. CRANK THAT DIAL AND CALL YOUR OTHER GLOATER MOTOR HOLDER BOTHER SHOULDER YOU SHOULD HOLD HER MOULD HER BOLSTER MY HOLSTER TOASTER SHOULDER SHAREHOLDER CALL YOUR MOTHER BROTHER BONER HOLDER I FUCKING TOLD HER.

  The new friend watches tentatively, in the corridor.
  The heap baby dry heap baby begins to smolder. baby, crank that dial baby, crack a sinful smile.
